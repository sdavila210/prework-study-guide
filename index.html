      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visual content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML is used to structures a webpage and provide a posistive user experience.</li>
        <li>We want to use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content and to give structure to the webpage.</li>
        <li>An element is the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
        <li>A tag is what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
        <li>ul element represents unordered lists</li>
        <li>ol element represents ordered lists</li>
        <li>li element represents list items representated in bullet or number lists</li>
        <li>img element contains information about images displayed on the webpage.</li>
        <li>br element creates a line of empty space</li>
        <li>We will continue to learn and use different elements and tags, such as the header tag, as we build our study guide.</li>  
    </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS</li>
        <li>Inline CSS: applies to specific HTML tag, using a style attribution with a CSS rule to style a particular page elemtn only.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in a head sections for the HTML file. These rules only apply to that page.</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet: allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. We link a file using LINK element placesd in the HTML head.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns is a term referring to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>git check out -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
        <li>We create feature branches so that we can use version control which is being able to track changes in our code.</li>
        <li>version control also allows us to collaborate with other developers more easily.</li>
        <li>We access git through the command line and use the command git at the beginning.</li>
        <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but we use GitHub to collaborate with others.</li>
        <li>Github is cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects in repositories.</li>
        <li>Repositories, or repos, are folders containing: files that contain code, files that contain information about the code such as README file, and version history for all the files in the repo.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>String: enclosed sequence of text in in single or double quotation marks.</li>
        <li>Number: numbers dont have quote around them</li>
        <li>Boolean: true/false values. The words true and false are special keywords that do not need quotes.</li>
        <li>Array: a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single regerence. It stores related data.</li>
        <li>Index: a location number to accept individual data inside the array, starting at 0.</li>
        <li>For loops: uses predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
        <li>Comments: snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser will ignore text marked as comments.</li>
        <li>Conditionals: code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. Example: if...else statements.</li>
        <li>We use the console.log method to log variables to the web console browser.</li>
        <li>We connect script.js to index.html by adding script element under the footer element in the body.</li>
        <li>Function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>Defining a function does not mean it will execute automatically, we must call it in our code.</li>
      </ul>
