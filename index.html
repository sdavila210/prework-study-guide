      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visual content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML is used to structures a webpage and provide a posistive user experience.</li>
        <li>We want to use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content and to give structure to the webpage.</li>
        <li>An element is the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
        <li>A tag is what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
        <li>ul element represents unordered lists</li>
        <li>ol element represents ordered lists</li>
        <li>li element represents list items representated in bullet or number lists</li>
        <li>img element contains information about images displayed on the webpage.</li>
        <li>br element creates a line of empty space</li>
        <li>We will continue to learn and use different elements and tags, such as the header tag, as we build our study guide.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>git check out -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
        <li>We create feature branches so that we can use version control which is being able to track changes in our code.</li>
        <li>version control also allows us to collaborate with other developers more easily.</li>
        <li>We access git through the command line and use the command git at the beginning.</li>
        <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but we use GitHub to collaborate with others.</li>
        <li>Github is cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects in repositories.</li>
        <li>Repositories, or repos, are folders containing: files that contain code, files that contain information about the code such as README file, and version history for all the files in the repo.</li>
